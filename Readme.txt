I did choose Snowflake for creating tables.

Below are account details:

https://fv99376.australia-east.azure.snowflakecomputing.com/console#/internal/worksheet
username: rathakur
password: R@j@t1994

Here you can find all tables created inside DEMO_DB database and schema will be PUBLIC

Also there will be three sheets one named as DDL containing DDL and DML queries.

The other three named as Q1, Q2, Q3 referes to task 1,2,3.

Q3 solution is uploaded in python along with the two csv being used for that.
